# StarBox 63 Requirements

## Overvew

This game is a simple side scrolling space shooting game. The player will
control a ship using the keyboard arrow keys or the W, A, S, D Keys Spacebar
will fire bullets.

Enemies will enter the screen from the right hand side and travel to the left
hand side at varying speeds. If an enemy makes it to the other side of the
screen no penalty will be given.

The player will only have 1 life so if they collide with an enemy ship the game
is over.

When bullets collide with enemy ships the enemy ships will dissappear. As time
goes on in the game the points rewarded for destroying an enemy ship will
increase.

## Future imporvements if there is time.

- different enemys some that take 2 or 3 bullets to hit and a color change when
  they are hit to indicate their health.

- levels with increaseing enemy difficulty and speed.

- global leaderboards.
